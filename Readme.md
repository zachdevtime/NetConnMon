# NetConnMon

Monitor your network connections while you work from home to diagnose connectivity issues.

This app also exists to give me an excuse to become versed in Blazor and some patterns.



## Todo:
* Make the UI app a wasm not just a server-side app, by wrapping the server Api with a Rest Api ala https://github.com/mumby0168/blog-samples/tree/main/new-features/MinimalApis / https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/issues/653
* finish authorization/authentication in the app
* finish Mudblazorification
